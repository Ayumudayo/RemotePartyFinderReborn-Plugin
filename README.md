# Report Partry Finder Reborn - Dalamud Plugin

A Dalamud plugin that collects Party Finder listings from FFXIV and synchronizes them to a remote server.

## Disclaimer

This is a fork of the [original Remote Party Finder project](https://github.com/zeroeightysix/remote-party-finder)'s client part by zeroeightysix.

**Note**: This plugin is a proof of concept created for personal interest. There are no plans for a public release.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Data Collection**: Scans in-game Party Finder listings and transmits them to the server.
- **Crowd Sourcing**: Contributes local PF data to the centralized web view.
- **Leader Info Collection**: Gathers party details for FFLogs integration on the server side.

## Configuration

The plugin is configured to send data to a specific server endpoint. Check `Configuration.cs` or the in-game plugin settings to point it to your local or hosted server instance.

## License

No license specified yet.
Since the original repository also does not have a license set, the license configuration is postponed.
