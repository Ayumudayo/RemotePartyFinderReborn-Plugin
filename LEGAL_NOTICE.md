# Legal and Provenance Notice

This repository contains code and behavior derived from upstream Remote Party Finder projects.

Known upstream sources include:

- `https://git.anna.lgbt/anna/remote-party-finder`
- `https://github.com/zeroeightysix/remote-party-finder`

At the time this notice was written, those upstream repositories did not include an explicit open-source license file.

## Current policy

- In the absence of an explicit license, inherited upstream code is treated as all rights reserved by default.
- This repository does not claim broad redistribution rights for inherited portions.
- New rewritten modules are authored to preserve behavior while reducing dependence on inherited implementations.
- Contributions only apply to the contributor's own work and do not relicense inherited upstream code.

## Project posture

- Conservative legal posture for internal/private use until explicit relicensing permission is obtained or clean-room replacement is completed.

This notice is a project policy statement and not legal advice.
